## Getting Started

To get started is easy. Follow these steps to get started with integration.

### Installation

Using mix, install the package from hex.pm by adding the dependency to `mix.exs`.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    ...
    {:vexilla_client_elixir, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
```



### Setup

You will need to create a Client within your app. This optionally takes in the `custom_instance_id` for use with gradual rollout as well as Selective features.

After creation, call `fetch_flags`. This can be chained from the constructor since it returns the client instance.

**Important Note**: All methods that make HTTP requests take in a callback for the request itself. This allows you to use your existing dependencies or standard library methods to keep this bundle smaller and less opinionated.

```elixir

```


### Usage

Use the created client to check if a feature `should?` be on.

```elixir

```


### Full Example

```elixir

```


## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags are useful for enabling or disabling parts of your application without having to redeploy. In some cases, such as mobile applications, the redeploy could take up to a week.

See more about them here:

- [https://featureflags.io](https://featureflags.io)
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle)

Feature Flags are also a fundamental building block for things such as A/B testing.

## How does it work?

The process is simple but has several steps to get up and running. Please see our in-depth guides in our [documentation](https://vexilla.dev/documentation).

## Generate Types (Optional)

We have created a tool to generate types for usage in your code. It will crawl your JSON structures and create consts or enums to help prevent typos and other "magic string" related issues. You just need to pass the URL of the JSON file where it is hosted.

### NPM

To use the tool, you can run it directly from NPM.

```
npx vexilla types elixir REMOTE_JSON_URL
```

### Automatic Install Script

You can also use a precompiled binary for your platform. This install script will automatically choose the right binary for you:

```
curl -o- -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vexilla/vexilla/main/install.sh | bash
```

The install script also accepts a target install path:

```
curl -o- -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vexilla/vexilla/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin/
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to download the binary manually you can get it from the releases section in Github, [https://github.com/vexilla/vexilla/releases](https://github.com/vexilla/vexilla/releases)
